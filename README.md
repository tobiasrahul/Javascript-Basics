Assessment Requirements
1. Create a variable that can hold a number of NFT's. 
2. Create an object inside your mintNFT function that will hold the metadata for your NFTs. 
   The metadata values will be passed to the function as parameters. When the NFT is ready, you will store it in the variable you created in step 1
3. Your listNFTs() function will print all of your NFTs metadata to the console (i.e. console.log("Name: " + someNFT.name))
4. For good measure, getTotalSupply() should return the number of NFT's you have created

Functionality :
  1. Has the ability to "mint" NFTs and store them
  2. You should "mint" at least three NFT's
  3. Has the ability to print the details of your NFTs to the console
  4. Has the ability to print the total supply of your NFT collection to the console
